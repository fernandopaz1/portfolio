                            <p>I specialize in building complex web applications, leading front-end teams, digital
                                product design and developing visual design systems. I enjoy creating effortless user
                                experience and designing delightful digital products. The entire process of going from a
                                concept to release and gathering user’s feedback on either client’s or my own products
                                is what makes me wake up everyday! Nowadays I lead product design at Tapdaq, previously
                                I worked at Badoo and Socialbakers.</p>
                            <p>Earlier in 2016 I started turning my expertise into building my own digital design
                                products. This helped me to learn even more about users and gain a deeper knowledge
                                about launching and selling stuff as an individual. My best known products across the
                                design community are currently Dashboard UI Kit 3.0 and Dashboard UI Kit totalling over
                                4000 sold copies.</p>
